        <h1>Ronaldo nets twice in thrilling win over Al-Ahli</h1>

        <img src="./pictures/al-nassr.webp">

        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo made the most of both awful defending and a plume of smoke to set Al-Nasr on the way to a 4-3 victory against Al-Ahli in the Saudi Pro League.</p>

        <p>With just four minutes on the clock, Ronaldo gave his side the perfect start against an Al-Ahli side that included Roberto Firmino, Riyad Mahrez and Allan Saint-Maximin.</p>

        <p>The Portuguese forward collected a Sadio Mane pass before capitalising on some poor defending and slotting past the goalkeeper through a plume of smoke following some pre-game pyrotechnics - despite not being able to see the goal.</p>

        <u><h1>Silva latest to join Man City's growing injury list</h1></u>

        <p>Silva was forced off before halftime of City's 3-1 home win over the Serbian side in their Champions League group opener on Tuesday.</p>

        <p>Table toppers City are already without Kevin De Bruyne, Mateo Kovacic, John Stones and Jack Grealish and Guardiola had said they were "in trouble" after Silva came off.</p>

        <p>"It's a little injury, a week to 10 days he will be out," Guardiola told reporters ahead of Saturday's home game against Nottingham Forest.</p>
